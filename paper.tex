\section{Introduction}
%

Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data (SIMD) and the related Single-Instruction, Multiple-Thread (SIMT) processing are two important vector-processing paradigms used increasingly in scientific computing.
Traditional multi-core parallelism is often used to increase central processing unit (CPU) performance, however SIMD processors---as well as SIMT processors, e.g., in the form of graphics processing units (GPUs)---have gained recognition due to their increased floating operation throughput.
The parallel programming standard OpenCL~\cite{stone2010opencl} has further enabled adoption of vector-processing based codes in scientific computing by providing a common application program interface (API) for execution on heterogeneous systems, e.g., the CPU, GPU, or Intel's Many Integrated Core architecture (MIC), etc.
In this discussion, we will largely use OpenCL terminology to describe these processing paradigms, as it provides a convenient way to classify otherwise disparate processor type (e.g., CPUs and GPUs), however the concepts discussed are broadly applicable to SIMD\slash SIMT processing and not tied to OpenCL specifically.

A single compute unit (e.g., a GPU streaming multiprocessor) contains many processing elements and hosts many threads, each with an instruction to execute (I1, I2).  Threads with the same instruction execute concurrently on multiple data while the others must wait (leading to thread divergence).}
      \label{F:SIMT}

\end{figure}

A typical modern CPU has many compute units (i.e., cores), each with specialized vector processing units capable of running SIMD instructions (\cref{F:SIMD}).
A SIMD instruction utilizes the vector processor to execute the same floating point operation (e.g. multiplication, division, etc.) on a several different data concurrently; the number of concurrent operations possible is known as the vector-width\footnote{OpenCL allows for use of vector-widths different from the actual hardware vector-width via implicit conversion, and may provide some performance benefit as will be studied in Sec.~\ref{S:results}} and is typically around 2--4 double precision operations. 
Additionally, specialized hardware accelerators, e.g. Intel's Xeon Phi co-processor (MIC) have been developed that have tens of cores with very wide vector-widths (e.g. 4--8 double precision operations); these very wide vector-widths are also found on cutting-edge and expected on forthcoming Intel CPUs (the Skylake Xeon and Cannon Lake architectures).

SIMT processing---the foundation of modern GPUs~\cite{lindholm2008nvidia}---is a related computing paradigm that hosts large groups of threads on a single compute element (a streaming multiprocessor in NVIDIA terminology).
A group of threads---typically \num{32} threads, known as a warp on NVIDIA GPUs---execute the same SIMD instruction on multiple data concurrently (\cref{F:SIMT}).
If some threads must execute a different instruction---e.g., due to if\slash then branching or predication---they are forced to wait and execute later.
This phenomena, known as thread-divergence, is a key consideration for SIMT-processing and can cause serious performance degradation for complicated algorithms~\cite{CurtisGPU:2017}.

\subsection{Previous works and goals of this study}
A number of recent works have investigated the use of high-performance SIMT-devices to accelerate reactive-flow and chemical kinetics simulations.
Spafford et al.~\cite{Spafford:2010aa} investigated an implementation of an explicit direct numerical simulation code for compressible turbulent combustion on a Tesla C1060 GPU, and found an order of magnitude speedup in evaluation of species production rates as compared to a serial CPU implementation on an AMD-Opteron processor.
Shi et al.~\cite{Shi:2011aa} developed a code to evaluate species production rates and factorize the chemical kinetic Jacobian on a Tesla C2050 GPU, and found an order of magnitude speedup during integration of large chemical models when these operations were offloaded to the GPU as compared to the standard \texttt{CHEMKIN}~\cite{kee1989chemkin} and \texttt{LAPACK}~\cite{Anderson:1999aa} libraries on a quad-core Intel i7 930 CPU; it was not clear how\slash if the CPU code was parallelized.
Niemeyer et al.~\cite{Niemeyer:2011aa} implemented an explicit fourth-order Runge--Kutta integrator for non-stiff chemical kinetic integration on a Tesla C2075 GPU, and found a speedup of nearly two orders of magnitude when compared with a sequential CPU-code on an Intel Xeon X5650 CPU.
Shi et al.~\cite{Shi:2012aa} later extended their work to develop a stabilized-explicit solver on a Tesla C2050; paired with a traditional implicit integrator on quad-core Intel i7 930 which handled the stiffest computational cells, an \SIrange{11}{46}{$\times$} speedup was achieved over the base implicit CPU integrator during simulation of a three-dimensional premixed diesel engine simulation.
Le et al.~\cite{Le2013596} implemented two high-order shock-capturing reactive-flow codes on a Tesla C2070, and found a \numrange{30}{50}$\times$ speedup over a sequential CPU version of the same code on a Intel Xeon X5650.
Stone and Davis~\cite{Stone:2013aa} implemented the implicit VODE~\cite{Brown:1989vl} integrator on a Fermi M2050 GPU, achieving an order of magnitude speedup over the baseline CPU version on a single core of an AMD Opteron 6134 Magny-Cours.
Niemeyer and Sung~\cite{Niemeyer:2014aa} later developed a stabilized explicit second-order Runge--Kutta--Chebyshev algorithm on a Tesla C2075, demonstrating an order of magnitude speedup for a over a CPU implementation of VODE on a six-core Intel X5650 for moderately stiff chemical kinetics.
Sewerin and Rigopoulos~\cite{Sewerin20151375} implemented a three-stage\slash fifth-order implicit Runge--Kutta method~\cite{wanner1991solving} on both a high-end (Nvidia Quadro 6000) and consumer-grade (Nvidia Quadro 600) GPUs, as well as a standard CPU (two-core, four-thread Intel i5-520M) and a scientific workstation (eight-core, 16-thread Intel Xeon E5-2687W); the high-end GPU was at best \SI{1.8}{$\times$} slower than the workstation CPU (16 threads), while the consumer level GPU was at best \SI{5.5}{$\times$} slower than the corresponding standard CPU (four threads).
Niemeyer et al.~\cite{Niemeyer:2016aa} additionally developed and validated an analytical chemical kinetic Jacobian code for the CPU and GPU.
Yonkee and Sutherland~\cite{Yonkee2016} implemented SIMT-accelerated evaluations of thermodynamic parameters, multicomponent transport properties and species production rates for solution of a partial differential equations (PDEs) on an Intel Xeon E5-2680 CPU and an Tesla K20 GPU.
In evaluation of the thermo-chemical properties, speedups between \SIrange{8}{13}{$\times$} were on 16 CPU cores, and \SIrange{20}{40}{$\times$} on the GPU; speedups of \textasciitilde\SI{9}{$\times$} and \textasciitilde\SI{25}{$\times$} were found in solution of a partially premixed methanol flame PDE on 16 CPU cores and the GPU respectively.
Curtis et al.~\cite{CurtisGPU:2017} implemented a fifth-order implicit Runge--Kutta method~\cite{wanner1991solving}, as well as two-fourth order exponential integration techniques~\cite{Hochbruck:1998,Hockbruck:2009} paired with an analytical Jacobian code~\cite{Niemeyer:2016aa} on a Tesla C2075; the implicit Runge--Kutta method was roughly equivalent to VODE running on 12--38 Intel Xeon E5-4640 v2 CPU cores for two smaller chemical models with an integration time step of \SI{e-6}{$\sec$}.

In contrast, SIMD-based chemical kinetics evaluation\slash integration have been far less studied.
Linford et al.~\cite{Linford:2011} implemented a three-stage, second-order Rosenbrock atmospheric chemical kinetics solver on the CPU, GPU and cell croadband engine (CBE)---a specially designed vector processor---and found speedups regularly exceeding~\SI{25}{$\times$} over a serial CPU implementation.
Kroshko and Spiteri~\cite{kroshko2013efficient} implemented a shallow-SIMD vectorized third order stiff Rosenbrock integrator for atmospheric chemistry on the CBE finding a speedup of \SI{1.89}{$\times$} over a serial version of the same code.
Stone et al.,~\cite{stone2016} implemented a linearly-implicit fourth-order stiff Rosenbrock solver in the OpenCL for various platforms including CPUs, GPUs, and MICs.
The shallow-SIMD and SIMT-vectorization models were implemented in OpenCL and compared to an OpenMP baseline code that was deep SIMD-vectorized by simple compiler hints (i.e., \texttt{\#pragmas}).
The shallow-SIMD vectorization improved the integrator performance over the OpenMP baseline by \SIrange{2.5}{2.8}{$\times$} on the CPU and \SIrange{4.7}{4.9}{$\times$} on the MIC, while the GPU performance was only \SIrange{1.4}{1.6}{$\times$} faster than the OpenMP baseline due to thread-divergence concerns.

This work will build upon our previous analytical chemical kinetic Jacobian code, \texttt{pyJac}~\cite{Niemeyer:2016aa}, in order to:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Derive and validate a new Jacobian formulation that greatly increases sparsity
 \item Enable cross-platform SIMD\slash SIMT vectorization for the CPU, GPU and other accelerators
 \item Investigate the performance for a wide range chemical kinetic models, specifically looking at speedups due to SIMD\slash SIMT-vectorization as well as relative to the previous version of \texttt{pyJac}, and finally
 \item Discuss future extensions to this work as well as the most promising directions for SIMD\slash SIMT vectorization in reactive-flow simulations
\end{itemize}
.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Data ordering and vectorization patterns}
\label{S:data}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{data_layouts.pdf}
      \caption{A simple 2-D data array with K rows and N columns.}
      \label{F:mem}
    \end{subfigure}
  \end{minipage}
  \hfil
  \begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{row_major.pdf}
	\caption{Row-major data ordering}
	\label{F:row_major}
    \end{subfigure}
    \\
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{column_major.pdf}
	\caption{Column-major data ordering}
	\label{F:column_major}
    \end{subfigure}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

When storing arrays for a chemical kinetic model, the data-storage layout and vectorization patterns are critical to achieving high-performance code.
\Cref{F:mem} depicts an example data array with K-rows and N-columns and index ($i$, $j$) corresponding to the $i$th row and $j$th column.
For example the concentration of species $j$ for the $i$-th thermo-chemical state would be stored in $[C]_{i, j}$ with $1 \le i \le N_{state}$, the number of thermo-chemical states considered, and $1 \le j \le \ns/$, the number of species in the model.
The stored concentrations would then have $K = N_{\text{state}}$ rows, and $N = N_{\text{sp}}$ columns.

In the ``C'' (C row-major) format, the concentrations of all species for a single thermo-chemical condition $i$ would be stored sequentially in memory, i.e., with  $[C]_{1, 1}$ in index \num{1}, $[C]_{1, 2}$ in index \num{2} etc. as shown in \cref{F:row_major}.
Conversely in the ``F'' (Fortran column-major) format, the concentrations of a single species $j$ over all thermo-chemical states are adjacent in memory, corresponding to storing $[C]_{1, 1}$ in index \num{1}, $[C]_{2, 1}$ in index \num{2} and so on, as shown in \cref{F:column_major}.
This ordering---along with the device (CPU, GPU, etc.) and vectorization pattern in question---have a large effect on the performance of SIMD\slash SIMT-vectorized algorithms.

In a \textit{shallow}-SIMD\slash SIMT vectorization (also referred to as ``per-thread'' in previous works~\cite{Stone:2013aa} using GPUs), each SIMD-lane (or SIMT-thread) in a compute-unit evaluates thermo-chemical source terms\slash chemical kinetic Jacobian for a different thermo-chemical state.
If the data is stored in ``F''-order, the SIMD-lanes\slash SIMT-thread accessing $[C]_{1, j}\ldots[C]_{L, j}$, the concentration of species $j$ for states $1, 2,\ldots L$---the size of the vector lane for SIMD or the number of threads in a SIMT warp---will load sequential locations in memory.
The first $(j+1)$th species concentration however, $[C]_{1, j+1}$, will be $N_{\text{state}}$ memory locations away; this increases the likelihood of cache-misses on the CPU~\cite{gray2000rules}, but conversely is well suited to coalesced memory accesses on the GPU~\cite{NVIDIA:2018}.

In a \textit{deep}-SIMD\slash SIMT vectorization (also referred to as ``per-block'' in previous GPU works), a compute-unit utilizes its SIMD-lanes\slash SIMT-threads cooperatively to evaluate the thermo-chemical source terms for a single thermo-chemical state, thus SIMD-lanes loading $[C]_{1, j} \ldots [C]_{1, j + L}$---the species concentrations for state 1, species $j \ldots j + L$---will access sequential memory locations if the data is stored in ``C''-order.
Further, in the ``C''-ordering the furthest difference between any two species concentrations within the same thermo-chemical state is at most $N_{\text{sp}}$, with $N_{\text{sp}} \ll N_{\text{state}}$ in most cases; this greatly improved data-locality increases the chances of a cache-hit on the CPU, but leads to uncoalesced memory-accesses on the GPU.
However, a deep vectorization requires both synchronization between SIMD-lanes\slash SIMT-threads, and may result in SIMD-waste\slash SIMT thread-divergence, caused by different SIMD-lanes\slash SIMT-threads executing different instructions (e.g. resulting from different if\slash then branches)

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.6\linewidth}
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{row_major_split.pdf}
	\caption{Row-major, shallow-vectorized data ordering}
	\label{F:row_major_split}
    \end{subfigure}
    \\
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{column_major_split.pdf}
	\caption{Column-major, deep-vectorized data ordering}
	\label{F:column_major_split}
    \end{subfigure}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{Vectorized data ordering patterns}
  \label{F:vector_data}
\end{figure}

Finally,~\cref{F:vector_data} shows a vectorized data-ordering that improves the caching patterns of a shallow, ``C''-ordered SIMD vectorization on the CPU (\cref{F:row_major_split}) and a deep, ``F''-ordered SIMT vectorization on the GPU (\cref{F:column_major_split}).
This is accomplished by splitting the slower-varying axis of the data array---rows for ``C''-ordering, and columns for ``F''-ordering---into chunks of size $L$ (the SIMD vector-width, or SIMT warp-size) and laying these data out contigously in memory.
For example, using the data-ordering in~\cref{F:row_major_split}, the concentration of species $j$ for states $i\ldots i+L$, $[C]_{i, j} \ldots [C]_{i + L, j}$, are contiguous in memory and are followed by the concentration of species $j + 1$ for the same states, $[C]_{i, j + 1} \ldots [C]_{i + L, j + 1}$.
This pattern, similar to OpenCL's native vector data-types---e.g., \texttt{double\num{8}} which treats \num{8} contiguous double precision floating point numbers as a single vector datum---ensures that any SIMD operation occurs on data that is contiguous in memory, greatly improving caching and SIMD-throughput.
Conversely, the data-ordering in~\cref{F:column_major_split} is designed to enable coalesced memory accesses for ``F''-ordered, deep-SIMT vectorization on the GPU.
The effects of these various data-ordering and vectorization patterns on performance will be studied in~\cref{S:results}.

\subsection{Thermo-chemical Source Terms and Jacobian}
This new version of \texttt{pyJac} is capable of evaluating the thermo-chemical source terms for using both the constant-pressure (\conp/) or constant-volume (\conv/) assumption\footnote{Note: in this context, the ``constant-pressure'' and ``constant-volume'' assumptions refer to evaluation within a reaction sub-step in the operator splitting scheme, rather than a general constant-pressure or constant-volume reactive-flow simulation.}
In this section, we will only outline a brief summary of the system evaluated by \texttt{pyJac}; the interested reader is referred to our complete derivations, attached as supplemental material to this document.

The thermo-chemical state vector derivation consists of the temperature, the non-constant thermodynamic state parameter (volume or pressure) and the number of moles of all species except the last in the chemical model which is typically taken to be the bath-gas (e.g., \ce{N2}):
\loadeq{state}
where $T$ is the temperature, $V$ and $P$ the volume and pressure respectively, and $n_j$ the number of moles of the $j$th species in the model (containing $\ns/$ total species).

This state vector---inspired by~\cite{SCHWER2002270}---has a number of features that recommend its use.
First, the state vector results in highly sparse chemical kinetic Jacobians as will be detailed in~\cref{S:sparsity}.
Second, mass is explicitly conserved in this formulation owing to the fact that the moles of the final species is calculated from the ideal gas law, and the rate of change of the final species from conservation of mass (see \cref{deriv-s:state,deriv-s:source} of the supplemental material respectively); i.e., system is not over-constrained.
Finally, the chemical kinetic Jacobian changes relatively little between the \conp/ and \conv/ forms, making maintaining the code-base much simpler.
Although most current combustion codes do not use species moles as a state variable, to\slash from more common mass\slash mole-fractions and moles is straightforward, and once inside integration of an chemical kinetic initial value problem, the choice of variables no longer matter.

The evolution of the thermo-chemical state vector is described by a set of chemical kinetic ordinary differential equations:
\loadeq{dstate}

For both \conp/ and \conv/, the molar source terms are~\cite{TurnsStephenR2012Aitc}:
\loadeq{dmolar}
where $\dot{\omega}_k$ is the $kth$ species' overall production rate:
\begin{equation}
 \dot{\omega}_{k} = \sum_{i=1}^{\nr/} \nu_{k, i} R_{i} c_{i}
\end{equation}
where $\nu_{k, i}$ is the net stoichiometic coefficient of species $k$ in reaction $i$, $R_{i}$ the net rate of progress of reaction $i$ (described in~\cref{deriv-s:rop_net} of the supplemental), and $c_{i}$ the pressure modification term i.e., for third-body (see~\cref{deriv-s:thdbody} of the supplimental), or fall-off\slash chemically-activated reactions (\cref{deriv-s:falloff} of the same).

The temperature source term~\cite{TurnsStephenR2012Aitc} is:
\loadeq{dtemp}
where $H_k$, $U_k$, $C_{p,k}$ and $C_{v, k}$ are the enthalpy, internal energy, constant-pressure and constant-volume specific heat of species $k$ in molar units respectively, while $[C]_{k}$ is the concentration, given by:
\begin{equation}
 [C]_{k} = \frac{n_{k}}{V}
\end{equation}
By differentiating the ideal gas law, the volume and pressure source terms can be found:
\loadeq{dparam}
where $\mathcal{R}$ is the ideal gas-constant.

The Jacobian entries computed by \texttt{pyJac} are arranged such that entry ($i$, $j$) corresponds to the partial derivative of the $i$-th source term in~\cref{e:source_terms} by the $j$-th state variable in~\cref{e:state}:
\loadeq{jacgeneral}

The derivative of the temperature source term with respect to itself is:
\loadeq{dTdotdT}
and with respect to the thermodynamic state parameter (the volume \slash pressure for \conp/\slash\conv/ respectively):
\loadeq{dTdotdE}
and the moles of species $j$:
\loadeq{dTdotdnj}

The derivative of the thermodynamic state parameter with respect to the temperature is:
\loadeq{dEdotdT}
and with respect to itself:
\loadeq{dEdotdE}
and finally, by the moles of species $j$:
\loadeq{dEdotdnj}

The molar source terms are more complicated due to the derivatives of the net rate of progress---see~\cref{deriv-s:dropi}---and pressure modification terms---\cref{deriv-s:dci}---for the reactions.
The reader is again encouraged to read the supplimental material covering the exact derivations and forms of the reactions solved by \texttt{pyJac}.
The derivative of the molar source term with respect to temperature is:
\loadeq{dnkdotdT}
while, similarly the derivative with respect to the state parameter is:
\loadeq{dnkdotdE}
and the moles of species $j$:
\loadeq{dnkdotdnj}

\subsection{Code Generation and Testing Infrastructure}
Code generation is enabled by the python package \texttt{loo.py}~\cite{kloeckner_loopy_2014}, which translates user specified psuedo-code and data to OpenCL\slash C-code.
This allows for easy changes of program structure, e.g. data ordering, vectorization, threading patterns and easy switching of target-languages (and simpler extension to additional languages, e.g., CUDA).
Additionally, \texttt{loo.py} can execute developed subroutines from python (natively for C-code, and via \texttt{PyOpenCL}~\cite{kloeckner_pycuda_2012} for OpenCL-code), enabling unit-testing\slash validation for each component of the Jacobian or source terms.
The source-terms and subcomponents thereof (e.g., rates of progress, pressure-modification terms, etc.) are directly compared to Cantera~\cite{Cantera}, while the automatic differentiation code Adept~\cite{adept-v11} is used to obtain reference answers for Jacobian subcomponents.
The Portable OpenCL (POCL) implementation~\cite{poclIJPP} and OpenMP~\cite{dagum1998openmp} are used to run OpenCL and C unit-testing, respectively, on the continous integration framework Travis CI~\cite{travis:2018}.
Validation of the complete (as opposed to the subcomponent testing discussed here) generated source-terms and Jacobian codes will be discussed in detail in~\cref{s:validation}.


\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Testing platforms and practical notes on OpenCL usage}

The performance and validation studies for this work were run on a variety of CPU and GPU platforms.
\Cref{t:cpus} shows the number of cores, vector instruction set and model of the CPUs used in this work; each CPU had both \texttt{v16.1.1} of the Intel OpenCL runtime~\cite{intelopencl:2018} and \texttt{v1.0} of the POCL~\cite{poclIJPP} runtime installed, each enabling OpenCL \texttt{v1.2} execution.
Additionally, \texttt{v5.0} of the LLVM\slash\texttt{clang}~\cite{Lattner:2004:LCF:977395.977673} compiler chain was installed on all machines to enable use of POCL.
In addition,~\cref{t:gpus} lists the model, number of CUDA cores and NVIDIA driver of each of the GPUs used in this work.
NVIDIA's OpenCL runtime is bundled with the NVIDIA driver~\cite{NVIDIA:2018}, hence we use driver version to specify the OpenCL runtime version.

Finally,~\cref{t:platforms} lists the platforms and vectorization\slash execution patterns they are capable of running.
It is important to note, that while OpenCL provides an easy way to enable cross-platform execution, there are some serious potential pit-falls in its use.
Typically speaking, the closed source OpenCL runtimes tested in this work (Intel and NVIDIA) contain more bugs that result in compilation failures or simply incorrect vectorized machine code; further, these runtimes (in our experience) tend to be less responsive to fixing said bugs, with relatively infrequent new releases (or in NVIDIAs case, change-logs of bugfixes).
As demonstration, we've created a minimum working example~\cite{nvidia_mwe} that demonstrates a failure of NVIDIA's OpenCL runtime corresponding to the GPU driver version \num{375.26} on a Tesla K40m GPU; by simply changing to another runtime (e.g., Intel), with no other code changes, the correct result can be found.
This provides a particularly vexing problem for the programmer, as there is often little that can be done to resolve the issue; thankfully, in this case we were able to upgrade the driver version to resolve the problem.

Further, the Intel and NVIDIA OpenCL runtimes lack a key feature---implementations of atomic operations on double precision variables---that are currently necessary for \texttt{pyJac} to run deep-vectorized code.
On the other hand, POCL is an open source OpenCL runtime that works on all CPU types tested in this work, and does implement these atomic operations; it is our experience that the POCL community is very responsive to bug reports and user outreach.
However, POCL's implicit vectorization module---which utilizes the LLVM compiler~\cite{Lattner:2004:LCF:977395.977673} to attempt to translate OpenCL code to vectorized machine code---typically fails to achieve much speedup, if any.
Thus POCL is a particularly useful tool for validation, but not necessarily for performance studies.
Thankfully, \texttt{loo.py} allows relatively easy switching between output languages; the only significant code change is building the wrapper that initializes\slash transfers memory and calls the kernel.
Indeed, the OpenMP code-generation built into \texttt{pyJac} is currently only capable of parallel-execution, but extending this platform to shallow\slash deep-vectorizations (via \texttt{loo.py}) is a key priority going forwards.
This discussion will be expanded upon in~\cref{s:future} to highlight the most promising future directions.

\subsection{Source term validation}
\label{s:validation}
The reaction rates of progress (ROP), species and temperature rates in this study are validated by comparison with Cantera~\cite{Cantera}, however special care must be taken due floating point arithmetic issues.

For a direct comparison, a relative error norm of a quantity $X_{ij}$ over all states $j$, and reactions (or species) $i$ was computed using the $L^{\infty}$ norm:
\begin{equation}
E_{X} = \left\lVert \frac{\left\lvert X_{ij,\text{CT}} - X_{ij}\right\rvert}{\num{e-10} + \num{e-6} * \left\lvert X_{ij,\text{CT}} \right\rvert} \right\rVert_{i,j,\infty}
\label{e:rel_err}
\end{equation}
where the \text{CT} subscript indicates values from Cantera~\cite{Cantera}

However, in computing the net ROP of reaction $i$ for state $j$ from the forward and reverse ROP: $R_{ij} = R_{ij}^{\prime} - R_{ij}^{\prime\prime}$, accuracy can easily be lost as the net ROP may be---particularly near chemical equilibrium---many orders of magnitude smaller than the forward or reverse rates.
To quantify this phenomena, the error in forward ROP is first defined as:
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon^{\prime}_{ij} = \left\lvert R_{ij}^{\prime} - R_{ij,\text{CT}}^{\prime} \right\rvert
\end{equation}
while the error in reverse ROP, $\varepsilon^{\prime\prime}_{ij}$, can be defined analogously.
Finally, for the reaction $i^{*}$ and state $j^{*}$ that result in the largest error in net ROP, i.e. $E_{R}$, an estimate of the error attributable to floating point error accumulation from the forward and reverse ROPs can be obtained as:
\begin{equation}
E_{\varepsilon} = \frac{\max(\varepsilon^{\prime}_{i^{*}j^{*}}\text{, }\varepsilon^{\prime\prime}_{i^{*}j^{*}})}{\num{e-10} + \num{e-6} * \left\lvert R_{i^{*}j^{*},\text{CT}} \right\rvert}
\end{equation}
This estimate allows for direct comparison of the error in forward or reverse ROPs to the value of the net ROP itself, if they are of similar magnitude the error in net ROP will be large.

}
\label{T:source_error}
\end{table}

In Table~\ref{T:source_error}, we see the results of this code as compared to Cantera~\cite{Cantera} on a library of partially stirred reaction conditions (PaSR) described in our previous works~\cite{CurtisGPU:2017,Niemeyer:2016aa}.
Very close agreement is observed for the forward and reverse ROP for all models, however the error norm is \textasciitilde\numrange{3}{4} orders of magnitude larger for the isopentanol model.
This results from differences in evaluation of P-Log reactions between \texttt{pyJac} and Cantera; namely \texttt{pyJac} computes the logarithm of the upper and lower reaction Arrhenius rates (see~\cref{deriv-s:pdep}) analytically while Cantera evaluates this term numerically.
If the error from P-Log reactions are not considered in~\cref{e:rel_err}, the forward and reverse ROP falls to \num{5.44e-08} and \num{1.59e-07} respectively.
We note that this discrepancy does not imply any incorrectness in either \texttt{pyJac} or Cantera---in fact, the error is still well within the proscribed tolerances in~\cref{e:rel_err}---but merely emphasizes the effect small code-changes can have on the accumulation of floating point errors.

This point is further underscored by the error in the net ROP, which is \textasciitilde\numrange{3}{9} orders of magnitude (or \numrange{7}{9} orders of magnitude for the P-Log excluded error) larger than the error in either the forward or reverse ROP.
In~\cref{T:source_error}, we see that $E_{\varepsilon}$ is very similar in magnitude to $E_R$ in all cases, indicating that this large increase in error is caused by the accumulation of floating point error from the forward and reverse ROPs, as previously discussed.
The molar species production rate error norm is similar in magnitude to that of the net ROP, however the temperature and state parameter rate errors again increases as the error in net species production rates is amplified by multiplication with thermodynamic properties.
Again, we note that the above discussion does not imply that discrepencies in computation of the net ROP will cause large error in chemical kinetic integration---either in this code or Cantera~\cite{Cantera}---as this loss of accuracy only occurs when the forward and reverse ROP are nearly equal, implying the reaction is in near-equilibrium.

\subsection{Jacobian validation}

As in our previous work~\cite{Niemeyer:2016aa}, the correctness of the Jacobian codes generated by \texttt{pyJac} was determined by comparison to the Jacobian obtained by automatic differentiation of the source rate subroutines generated by \texttt{pyJac} via the \texttt{Adept} software library~\cite{adept-v11,hogan2014fast}.
The reasons for this choice are explained fully in~\cite{Niemeyer:2016aa}, but broadly speaking automatic differentiation provides relatively fast, highly accurate Jacobian matrix evaluation with minimal additional programming little effort.
The discrepancy between the analytical and automatic differentiated Jacobians for thermo-chemical state $k$, denoted by $\mathcal{J}_k$ and $\hat{\mathcal{J}}_k$ respectively, is determined by the relative error Frobenius norm over all Jacobian indicies $i, j$:
\begin{equation}
 \label{e:jac_error_base}
 E_{\text{rel}, k} = \frac{\left\lVert \hat{\mathcal{J}}_{ijk} - \mathcal{J}_{ijk} \right\rVert_{i,j,F}}{\left\lVert \hat{\mathcal{J}}_{ijk} \right\rVert_{i,j,F}}
\end{equation}

To avoid large relative errors of small nonzero Jacobian elements due to accumulation of floating point error, the Frobenius norm of the automatically differentiated Jacobian is calculated over all thermo-chemical states $k$:
\begin{equation}
 \label{e:thresh}
 \mathcal{T} = \left\lVert \mathcal{\hat{J}} \right\rVert_{k, F}
\end{equation}
The error statistics reported in this section are then based only on matrix elements where $\mathcal{J}_{ijk} \ge \frac{\mathcal{T}}{\mathcal{C}}$; this filtered form of~\cref{e:jac_error_base} is denoted $E_{\mathcal{C}}$.

}
\label{T:error}
\end{table}

\Cref{T:error} presents the error statistics of \texttt{pyJac} over the tested PaSR thermo-chemical condition database.
For all tested cases, the maximum filtered error norm is less than unity.
The filtered error norm is largest for the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} model with the more stringent tolerance ($\mathcal{C} = 10^{20}$).
We note that $\mathcal{T}$ for this model is smaller than the tolerance in this case, and hence we are comparing numbers smaller than $\mathcal{O}(1)$; relaxing the tolerance to $\mathcal{C} = 10^{15}$ significantly lowers the filtered error norm to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$.
Similar error characteristics are seen for all models except GRI-Mech 3.0---in which the error norms for both tolerances are $\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$---that is a larger error norm for the more stringent tolerance that drops 2--4 orders of magnitude for the relaxed tolerance.

\subsection{Sparsity patterns}
\label{S:sparsity}

In general, the Jacobian matrices generated by \texttt{pyJac} are largely sparse with non-zero entries mainly corresponding to species that participate in the same reaction (or non-default efficiency third-body species in a reaction), and mostly dense rows \slash columns corresponding to the temperature and thermodynamic state parameter.
However, the explicit-mass conservation formulation of \texttt{pyJac} can introduce additional non-zero entries in two ways.
First, if the last-species in the model (i.e., the bath-gas) participates directly in a reaction, the derivative of the forward or reverse rate of progress with respect to any other species is non-zero (see~\cref{deriv-s:dri_dnj}).
Similarly, if the last-species has a third-body efficiency not equal to the default (unity), this will again force all the derivative of the pressure-modification term with respect to other species to be non-zero (see~\cref{deriv-s:dci_thd}).
Either case will result in an undesirable fully dense Jacobian row for all species that have a non-zero net stoichiometic coefficient in such a reaction.

However, \texttt{pyJac} allows the user to simply ignore these derivatives (via a command-line switch) to and avoid any negative adverse affects on the Jacobian sparsity.
The rational behind this choice is that many common implicit integration techniques (e.g., CVODE~\cite{cvode:2.8.2}) used in solution of chemical kinetic initial value problems are formulated around the assumption that the supplied Jacobian is approximate; this allows the Jacobian and its LU factorization to be reused for multiple internal integration time-steps, accelerating the solution process.
For such solvers, there is no need for the exact form of the Jacobian and the so-called ``approximate'' form is preferable.
Hence, in this section we will detail the sparsity of both forms of the Jacobian for the chemical models tested.

In~\cref{F:jac_sparsity}, a graphical representation of the sparsity pattern for GRI-Mech 3.0 is displayed.
In particular we note that~\cref{F:jac_sparse_approx} is has several rows that are no longer fully-dense, as result of its approximate form -- these rows correspond to species directly interacting with \ce{N2}, largely in GRI-Mech 3.0's \ce{NOx} chemistry reactions.
\cref{T:jac_sparsity} shows the density of the exact and approximate Jacobians for all mechanisms tested in this work.
The smallest model, \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} is very dense with \textasciitilde\SI{70}{\percent} of the Jacobian entries non-zero however this drops to just \textasciitilde\SI{50}{\percent} for GRI-Mech 3.0, and continues to decrease to \textasciitilde\SI{27}{\percent} for USC-Mech II and just \textasciitilde\SI{10}{\percent} for the isopentanol model.
The approximate Jacobian assumption drops the density of Jacobian by \textasciitilde\SIrange{3}{7}{\percent} for all models.

\subsection{Performance}
\label{S:results}
The performance studies in this work were run on the platforms listed in~\cref{t:cpus,t:gpus}.
Runtimes in each case were averaged over ten runs, each using the same set of PaSR conditions utilized in validation.
The wrapping code---responsible for initializing\slash transfering memory, reading input, etc.---was compiled with \texttt{gcc v5.4.0} on the \avx/\slash\gpunew/ platforms, and \texttt{gcc 4.8.5} on the \sse/\slash\gpuold/ machines.
The optimization level ``\texttt{-O3}'' was used in all cases, and no ``fast-math'' OpenCL optimizations were enabled.
Additionally, the ``exact'' form of the Jacobian (as opposed the the ``appropriate'' form discussed in~\cref{S:sparsity}) was used in all cases.
Finally, unless otherwise stated the \conp/ assumption was used, a vector width of \num{8}\slash\num{128} was used for all CPU\slash GPU cases respectively, ``C''\slash ``F''-ordered data was used on the CPU\slash GPU, and the runtimes reported are for the number of conditions specified in~\cref{T:error} and include data transfer overhead to\slash from internal buffers used in \texttt{pyJac}.
The effects of choice of vector-width on the CPU\slash GPU, as well as the differences between \conp/ and \conv/ evaluations will be explored in~\cref{S:source_results}, and briefly discussed in~\cref{S:jacobian_results}.

\subsubsection{Source term evaluation}
\label{S:source_results}

\Cref{F:cpu_source} explores the performance of the source term evaluations generated by \texttt{pyJac} on the CPU test platforms listed in~\cref{t:cpus}.
Source term evaluations, critial in their own right for direct numerical simulations~\cite{Spafford:2010aa} among other applications, also give us a convenient platform to detail the effects of various code configuration options before investigating the more involved Jacobian evaluation peformance.

In~\cref{F:intel_source_noorm}, the mean runtime per initial condition is shown for both the~\avx/ and~\sse/ CPUs, using both Intel OpenCL and OpenMP.
This normalization is chosen to account for the varying numbers of conditions in the PaSR databases for each model (\cref{T:error}).
For both CPUs, the OpenMP implementation is the slowest over all models; interestingly the parallel (non-vectorized) Intel OpenCL code is slightly faster than OpenMP in all cases.\todo{rerun OpenMP w/ mtune=native}
As expected, the \avx/ machine is moderately faster than the \sse/ CPU; additionally, the shallow-vectorized OpenCL code is significantly faster than either the OpenMP or unvectorized OpenCL codes on both processors.

In~\cref{F:intel_source}, the extent of this speedup is detailed; we note that the speedup displayed is calculated per-machine, such that the speedup of the shallow-vectorized OpenCL code can be readily assessed.
On both machines, the unvectorized OpenCL code is \textasciitilde\SIrange{1.25}{1.5}{$\times$} faster than the baseline parallel OpenMP code.
Additionally, the shallow-vectorized OpenCL code is \textasciitilde\SIrange{2.5}{3}{$\times$} and \textasciitilde\SIrange{3.5}{4}{$\times$} faster than the OpenMP code for the \sse/ and \avx/ machines respectively.
In contrast,~\cref{F:pocl_source} shows the runtime of deep, shallow and unvectorized OpenCL codes on the POCL runtime, as compared to OpenMP parallelization.
No speedup is achieved for either vectorization type on either CPU; indeed the OpenMP is faster in both cases.
The reasons for this lack of vectorization are quite technical and somewhat outside the scope of this work, however briefly speaking vectorization might be achieved on POCL via a combination of relaxed math (``-cl-fast-relaxed-math''), use of explicit OpenCL vector types and newer versions of LLVM (specifically, potential improvments to the vectorization module).
This will be explored more in future work, but for the moment POCL is still quite useful as a validation tool.

\Cref{F:gpu_source} shows the performance of the source term evaluation on the GPUs listed in~\cref{t:gpus}.
In~\cref{F:gpu_source_scaling}, the number of initial conditions over which the source terms are evaluated on the \gpunew/ GPU is varied in order to determine the effect on the mean runtime per condition; the mean runtime continues to decrease for all chemical models until \textasciitilde\num{e4} conditions, at which point the GPU becomes saturated and performance levels off.
\Cref{F:gpu_source_speedup} shows the speedup in source term evaluations the \gpunew/ GPU over the \gpuold/ GPU for the maximum number of conditions in~\cref{F:gpu_source_scaling}; the speedup ranges from \textasciitilde\SIrange{1.75}{2.5}{$\times$} depending on the chemical model in question.
Additionally,~\cref{F:gpu_source_speedup} shows that varying the vector width size (a.k.a., the block size in NVIDIA terminology) has minimal effect on performance; it is possible that use of larger vector sizes could have an effect on performance, but this was not considered in this work.\todo{rerun NVIDIA on srv2 -- see if that high variability in isopentanol persists}

\Cref{f:source_permutate} shows the effect of changing data-ordering patterns as well as the \conp/ or \conv/ formulation on the performance of source term evaluation in \texttt{pyJac}.
In~\cref{F:source_conpvsconv}, we see that choice of the constant-pressure or constant-volume formulation has little to no effect on runtime for OpenMP as well as the shallow-vectorized\slash unvectorized Intel OpenCL codes on the \avx/ machine.
Generally speaking, the difference between the \conp/ and \conv/ formulations has little effect on performance regardless of CPU\slash GPU choice, or even for Jacobian evaluation which will be explored later.

In contrast,~\Cref{F:source_cvsf} shows large speedups of ``C''-ordered data over ``F''-ordered data on the \avx/ machine; the speedup presented is calculated per language, i.e., the roughly \SIrange{1.5}{2}{$\times$} speedup of the ``C''-ordered OpenMP implementation is relative to the ``F''-order OpenMP baseline while the OpenCL speedups are given with respect to the ``F''-ordered unvectorized OpenCL code.
Additionally, we note that the ``C''-ordered shallow-vectorization in~\cref{F:source_cvsf} utilizes the vectorized-data ordering described in~\cref{S:data}.
In general, the data-ordering has a much more profound affect on the vectorized-OpenCL codes; this is due to the nature of SIMD-operations, which are much more efficient when operating on contiguous (in memory) data rather than incurring an expensive memory ``gather'' operation.
The ``C''-ordered unvectorized OpenCL code (which uses the default unvectorized row-major data ordering) is \textasciitilde\SIrange{1.5}{2.5}{$\times$} faster than the unvectorized ``F''-ordered code, and is in some cases almost as fast as the ``F''-ordered shallow-vectorized OpenCL implementation.
However, the ``C''-ordered shallow-vectorization achieves speedups of \textasciitilde\SIrange{4}{7}{$\times$} demonstrating the value of the vectorized data ordering for CPU execution.

\Cref{F:source_gpu_cvsf} shows the effect of the ``C'' versus ``F''-ordering on source term evaluation performance on both GPUs.
The speedup reported is calculated per-GPU, such that the effect of data ordering can be seen on each individual GPU.
In general, the ``C''-ordered shallow-vectorization is \textasciitilde\SIrange{1.05}{1.2}{$\times$} faster on the \gpunew/ GPU while the ``C'' and ``F''-ordered data are nearly equivalent for the \gpuold/ GPU, except for the isopentanol model where the ``F''-ordered data is \textasciitilde\SI{1.4}{$\times$} faster (though, we note that there was high variablity in this case). \todo{again, pending rerun on \gpuold/}
The ``C''-ordered speedup on the \gpunew/ GPU is counter to what one might expect, as typically speaking coalesced memory access in a shallow-vectorization is easier to achieve if ``F''-ordering is used (see~\cref{S:data}).
However, the vectorized-data ordering here ensures that not only are memory accesses aligned to the vector width size (and thus, likely coalesced) but the improved data-locality; coupled with the larger cache sizes of the \gpunew/ GPU result in this modest speedup for ``C''-data ordering.

Finally,~\cref{F:source_scaling} displays the (strong) parallel scaling efficiency and SIMD efficiency for the CPU platforms.
The strong parallel scaling efficiency is defined as:
\begin{equation}
 \label{e:strong_scaling}
 \varepsilon = \frac{\bar{t}_{1}}{N \bar{t}_{N}}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{t}_{N}$ is the mean runtime per condition on $N$ CPU cores, and $\bar{t}_{1}$ the same on a single CPU core.
The strong parallel scaling efficiency measures the speedup due to the use of additional CPU cores, as a fraction of linear speedup; strong scaling tends to decrease with the number of processors used due to memory bandwidth limitations and decreasing computation work allocated per CPU core~\cite{strong_scaling}.

\Cref{F:source_parallel_scaling} shows the strong parallel scaling efficiency of source rate evaluation in \texttt{pyJac} on the \avx/ machine for both the shallow-vectorized Intel OpenCL and OpenMP codes.
In general, the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} mechanism has the worst scaling efficiency for Intel OpenCL; although the mechanism scalings vary somewhat for OpenMP, there is no clear trend.
It is likely the poor scaling of the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} for Intel OpenCL results from both its relatively small size, and few falloff\slash chemically activated reaction (and in particular, the additional expensive logarithm and exponential evaluations that accompany them); i.e., there is simply not enough work to fully utilize the SIMD intructions.
Additionally, OpenMP tends to have higher scalings then the shallow-vectorized OpenCL code, e.g., \textasciitilde\num{0.8} and \textasciitilde\num{0.7} for \num{4} and \num{8} CPU cores respectively, compared to just \textasciitilde\num{0.7} and \textasciitilde\num{0.5} for OpenCL; although not pictured (to keep the figure readable), the unvectorized Intel OpenCL code has only slightly worse scaling than the OpenMP code, hence the SIMD-vectorization itself the cause of this poorer scaling.
This is again likely due to relatively small amounts of work associated with source rate evaluation; the longest runtime (the isopentanol model on a single core) takes only \textasciitilde$\SI{2}{\sec}$ for OpenCL, and \textasciitilde$\SI{9}{\sec}$ for OpenMP.
By the time 4--8 CPU cores are utilized, the runtime of shallow-vectorized OpenCL code can be measured in hundreds of milliseconds, and parallel overhead begins to dominate, decreasing efficiency.
In contrast, the OpenMP code requires \textasciitilde\num{4} cores to run as fast as the shallow-vectorized OpenCL code in this case, hence parallel overhead concerns become increasingly important for 8--16 cores.
Indeed, we will see that the strong scalings for sparse Jacobian evaluation---the most computationally intensive task in this work for which the efficiency will investigated---are far more similar between Intel OpenCL and OpenMP.

The SIMD efficiency is defined as:
\begin{equation}
 \label{e:simd_efficiency}
 \varepsilon_{\text{SIMD}} = \frac{\bar{t}_{\text{unvec}}}{W \bar{t}_{\text{shallow}}}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{t}_{\text{unvec}}$ is the mean runtime per condition of the unvectorized OpenCL code, $\bar{t}_{\text{shallow}}$ the same for the shallow-vectorized OpenCL code, and $W$, the vector width reported in number of double operations in~\cref{t:cpus}
This measure compares the actual speedup due to shallow-vectorization compared to the nominal vector-width of the machine in question.
\Cref{F:source_simd_scaling} shows the SIMD efficiency of source term evaluation in \texttt{pyJac} on a single core of the \avx/ machine; the larger models have higher SIMD-efficiency, \textasciitilde\num{0.75}, and the smaller models have lower SIMD-efficiency, \textasciitilde\num{0.625}.
This again demonstrates that the SIMD-vectorization becomes efficient as the amount of work to perform increases (with increasing model size).
Interestingly,~\cref{F:source_sse_simd_scaling} shows the SIMD efficiency on the \sse/ machine as greater than one; this is likely caused by a combination of use of an OpenCL vector-width greater than the native CPU vector-width (i.e., \num{8} v.s., \num{2}), and the improved data-locality for the vectorized-data ordering, as discussed in~\cref{S:data}, and results a modest \textasciitilde\SIrange{10}{25}{\percent} improvement over the nominal vector width.

\section{Conclusions}
In this work, automatically generated OpenCL codes for shallow SIMD-vectorized thermo-chemical source term evaluation were developed and validated against Cantera~\cite{Cantera} for a shallow range of chemical kinetic models~\cite{Burke:2011fh,smith_gri-mech_30,Wang:2007,Sarathy:2013jr}.
Significant speedups of up to \SIrange{1.90}{2.45}{$\times$} over a baseline SIMT-vectorized code were observed.
Two data-ordering schemes were investigated, showing a clear performance benefit for use of the ``C'' (row-major) ordering for the shallow vectorized code.
Further, this study suggests that a deep SIMD-vectorized code---currently under development---may see even greater accelerations due to expected increases in cache-hit rates.
Larger vector-widths were found to provide accelerations for the smaller models studied, but the speedup was similar over all vector-widths tested for the largest models investigated.
Finally, the strong parallel scaling efficiency was examined for the shallow vectorized code; the larger models exhibited higher scaling efficiency, possibly due to failure of the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} model to saturate the CPU throughput.
Future extensions of this work will include development of a SIMD\slash SIMT-accelerated sparse-analytical Jacobian code targeted at CPUs, GPUs, and MICs.
